        <p class="item__content">
          Conservation Areas were established 50 years ago in 1967 by the Civic
          Amenities Act and the Bloomsbury Conservation Area Advisory Committee
          (BCAAC), held an event to celebrate their important contribution to

          Hugh Cullum Architects, the Conservation Advisory Committee was
          addressed by Frank Dobson, the long-serving MP for Holborn and St

          years and has supported BCAAC throughout by actively championing the
          cause of conservation in the local area. The Bloomsbury Conservation
          Area is large: approximately 160 hectares and is bounded by Euston
          Road to the north and High Holborn and Lincoln's Inn Fields to the
          south and from Tottenham Court Road in the west to King's Cross Road
          in the east. The Bloomsbury Conservation Area was one of the first to
          be designated after Conservation Areas were established in 1967…
